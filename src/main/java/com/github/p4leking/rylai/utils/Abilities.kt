/** The ability name and description can be chosen freely.
 * The enum name must be equivalent to the function name of the ability for it to be cast correctly.
 * The icon should not be obtainable, because it will get item cooldown on cast.
 * The cooldown should be the number of game ticks (seconds * 20).
 * The force value (damage/duration/percentage) is specified for level 1. Level 100 players will do double that amount.
 * A force value of 0 implies that the skill doesn't scale with level */
